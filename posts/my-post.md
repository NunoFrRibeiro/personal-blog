## How does this blog work?

This first blog post is a 2 part series.

1) In this first post I will address how I made the blog

2) In the second part how CI is made.

## So, lets start with how this blog works.

First I have to say that the backend for this blog was heavely inspired by [this](https://fluxsec.red/how-I-developed-a-markdown-blog-with-go-and-HTMX) blog post.

A few changes were made, mainly to the libraries used to run the server.
